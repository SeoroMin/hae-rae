### Introduction
The korean longform dataset sprint team has the goal of generating instruction and tuning the existing model according to the characteristics of the long Korean corpus. Therefore, we have a contribution to generate more correct responses by sampling according to the characteristics of the long Korean corpus and generating instruction.

### Dataset
We collected three data from the economic domain with long corpus. 
1) Economic and industrial categories in large-scale web data-based Korean corpus data (AI Hub)
2) Crawllwing 4353 documents from Naver Encyclopedia with keywords "finance" "economy" "investment"
